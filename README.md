## Available Script
In the project directory, you can run:

# ```npm start```

You need to add a file `.env.local` at project's root to set the `API URL`:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL='{`API URL}'
```
Whithout this, the app will use `http://localhost:5000`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

# `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
